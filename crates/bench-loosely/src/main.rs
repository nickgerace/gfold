//! This is the loose bench for gfold. Why use a loose bench over a precise one? Most of gfold
//! development happens with a mobile processor, which is prone to performance fluctuations over
//! background I/O operations, battery life and temperature. Moreover, the "real world" use case of
//! gfold is via CLI and not a library. Thus, this loose bench executes gfold as a CLI similarly
//! to real world use. This benchmark is not precise and is designed to give a high level overview.

// TODO(nick): add consistency deviation. We should see how far each result strays from the average.
// We want gfold to perform consistently as well as quickly.
