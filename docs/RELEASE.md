# Release

This document contains all information related to release.

## Versioning Scheme

This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
Generally, the versioning scheme looks like the following formats where `X` is an unsigned integer:

- **Release candidates (RCs):** `X.X.X-rc.X`
- **Full releases:** `X.X.X`

## Overview

If only `gfold` has changed, release `gfold` alone.
If `libgfold` has changed, release `libgfold` and _then_ `gfold`.
