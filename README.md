`gfold` is a CLI-driven application that helps you keep track of multiple Git repositories.

```sh
% gfold
astrid  unclean   main       git@github.com:db/astrid.git
fev     bare      main       https://github.com/institute/fev.git
gb      unpushed  dev        https://github.com/hrothgar/gb.git
neloth  unclean   patch      git@github.com:telvanni/neloth.git
pam     clean     main       https://github.com/onc/pam.git
prime   clean     issue2287  git@github.com:bos/prime.git
```

## Description and Motivation

This app displays relevant information for multiple Git repositories in one, or multiple, directories.
While this tool might seem limited in scope and purpose, that is by design.

It prints each repository in alphabetical order, and pads each result based on the longest directory, branch, and status string.
By default, `gfold` looks at every Git repository via traversal from the current working directory.
However, if you would like to target another directory, you can pass that path (relative or absolute) as the first argument.

## Installation

There multiple methods for installing `gfold`.

### Homebrew and Linux Brew

You can use [macOS Homebrew](https://brew.sh) or [Linuxbrew](https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-on-Linux) to install the [tap](https://github.com/nickgerace/homebrew-gfold).

```sh
brew install nickgerace/gfold/gfold`
```

### AUR

You can use a Linux distribution that supports installing packages from the AUR, [Arch User Respository](https://aur.archlinux.org/), to install the following:

- [gfold](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/gfold/) - builds from source
- [gfold-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/gfold-git/) - development package

Many people choose to use an [AUR helper](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/AUR_helpers), such as [yay](https://github.com/Jguer/yay) or [paru](https://github.com/Morganamilo/paru), in order to install their AUR packages.

```sh
yay -S gfold
paru -S gfold
```

### Cargo

You can use [cargo](https://crates.io) to install the [crate](https://crates.io/crates/gfold) on almost any platform.

```sh
cargo install gfold
```

## Usage

Pass in the `-h`, or `--help`, flag to see all the options for using this application.
